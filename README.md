# Car Analysis and Dashboard Web App

## Project Description
This project is a web-based dashboard built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to explore and analyze a dataset of cars listed for sale in the United States. The dataset includes attributes such as price, condition, odometer reading, model year, and more.

The web app provides interactive visualizations to examine relationships between key features, such as:
- Model year vs. odometer (miles)
- Price vs. condition

The project is accompanied by an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook, which pre-processes the dataset and highlights key insights.
